Build MacPorts ports in a continuous integration environment.

Global options:

  --prefix=<path>
    The prefix of the MacPorts installation that will be used for
    building ports. Defaults to \`/opt/local'.

  --work-dir=<path>
    A working directory to be used for storing temporary files,
    accessible by the MacPorts installation specified with \`--prefix'.
    The directory should persist between runs of \`mpbb'. Defaults to
    the value of \$PWD or \`/tmp/mpbb'.

Available commands:

  ${cmds[0]}$(printf ', %s' "${cmds[@]:1}")

Run \`$prog help <command>' for per-command help.
